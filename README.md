# Hi, I'm Ellie! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data analyst with experience in epidemiology. I have just completed my PhD with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), focusing on surveillance data for Campylobacter and analysing disease patterns using area-level statistics. 

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I am currently using BigQuery AutoML to build a regression model that predicts disease rates based on small-area characteristics.
- ðŸŒ± I am continuously improving my skills in SQL, Python, and PowerBI.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on any analytics projects working with spatial data. My expertise in handling and analysing geographic information systems (GIS) data can be valuable for projects that require spatial analysis.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been stuck upside down in a cave 

## Skills

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

- Languages: R, Python
- Tools: PowerBI, Tableau
- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL

## Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/eb1383/LoadNetCDF): R-pipeline to extract and analyse high-resolution gridded climate data, facilitating the analysis with surveillance data.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/eb1383/MCMC): Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate infection rates based on travel and genetic data, while accounting for missing or incomplete data.
