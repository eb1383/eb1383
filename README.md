# Hello there! 👋  

I'm a statistician and data scientist with a PhD in Health Data Science from the University of Warwick. My work sits at the intersection of **data science, public health, and epidemiology**. I specialise in **machine learning, time series forecasting, and geospatial modelling**. Outside of the data world, I love climbing, caving, and archery 🎯

## 🚀 What am I working on?  

- 🧗‍♂️ Building a machine learning model to search UKC for the perfect climb (super steep, big jugs, nice scenery)
- Finding the optimum time of year to send a boulder given temporal ascent trends
- 🦇 Spatiotemporal analysis of cave-rescue incidents from 1980-present
- 💪 Building an agent-based model to predict gym equipment usage

## 🔬 Notable Projects  

### 🔹 **[Climate Data Processing](https://github.com/eb1383/LoadNetCDF)**  

🌍 **How does climate affect health?** This R-based data pipleine integrates 5x5km gridded climate data with area-level public health surveillance datasets to explore associations between climate and notifable disease incidence, given large scale missingness in the data.

### 🔹 **[MCMC Bayesian Model for Infection Estimation](https://github.com/eb1383/MCMC)**  

🧬 **How can we estimate disease spread with incomplete data?** This project applies a Bayesian hierarchical model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate infection rates based on travel and genetic data.

## 🤝 Collaboration 

I’m always keen to collaborate on data-driven projects that have a real-world impact, so if you are working on something cool and need **a data scientist with epidemiological expertise**, let’s connect! 🚀
