# Hello there! 👋  

I'm a statistician and data scientist with a PhD in Health Data Science from the University of Warwick. My work sits at the intersection of **data science, public health, and epidemiology**. I specialise in **machine learning, time series forecasting, and geospatial modelling**. Outside of the data world, I love climbing, caving, and archery 🎯

## 🚀 What am I working on?  

- 🧗‍♂️ Building a machine learning model to search UKC for the perfect climb (super steep, big jugs, nice scenery)
- 🦇 Spatiotemporal analysis of cave-rescue incidents from 1980-present
- 💪 Building an agent-based model to predict gym equipment usage

## 🔬 Notable Projects  

### 🔹 **[Climate Data Processing](https://github.com/eb1383/LoadNetCDF)**  

🌍 **How does climate affect health?** This R-based data pipleine integrates 5x5km gridded climate data with area-level public health surveillance datasets to explore associations between climate and notifable disease incidence.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- 📡 **Extracting NetCDF Climate Data:** Processes daily maximum temperature (`tasmax`) from NetCDF datasets.  
- 🏡 **Geospatial Integration:** Aligns temperature data with LSOA (Lower Super Output Area) shapefiles for local-level analysis.  
- 🔄 **Automated Data Processing:** Standardises and cleans inconsistencies in metadata across sources.  
- 📊 **Prepares Data for Analysis:** Generates structured datasets for statistical modelling.

### 🔹 **[MCMC Bayesian Model for Infection Estimation](https://github.com/eb1383/MCMC)**  

🧬 **How can we estimate disease spread with incomplete data?** This project applies a Bayesian hierarchical model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate infection rates based on travel and genetic data.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- 📊 **Predictive Disease Modelling:** Uses **hierarchical Bayesian inference** to estimate hidden infections.  
- ✈️ **Accounts for Travel Data:** Incorporates mobility patterns to model transmission pathways.  
- 🧪 **Integrates Genetic Information:** Leverages genomic sequences for more accurate outbreak tracking.  
- ❓ **Handles Missing Data:** Uses probabilistic methods to adjust for incomplete records.
