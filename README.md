# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a statistician with a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick. My expertise lies in machine learning, time series analysis, forecasting, and modelling, with a strong foundation in Python and R . I have experience working with complex public health surveillance datasets, ensuring data integrity, and delivering actionable insights through analytical projects.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on data migration and predictive modeling projects.
- ðŸŒ± I am continuously improving my skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data science and machine learning.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been stuck upside down in a cave 

## Skills

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

- Languages: R, Python, SQL
- Tools: PowerBI
- Databases: PostgreSQL
