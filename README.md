## 🔬 Notable Projects  

### 🔹 **[Climate Data Processing](https://github.com/eb1383/LoadNetCDF)**  

🌍 **How does climate affect health?** This R-based **climate-epidemiology pipeline** integrates **high-resolution gridded climate data** with **public health surveillance datasets** to explore links between **temperature and disease trends**.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- 📡 **Extracting NetCDF Climate Data:** Processes daily **maximum temperature (`tasmax`)** from NetCDF datasets.  
- 🏡 **Geospatial Integration:** Aligns temperature data with **LSOA (Lower Super Output Area) shapefiles** for local-level analysis.  
- 🔄 **Automated Data Processing:** Standardises and cleans inconsistencies in metadata across sources.  
- 📊 **Prepares Data for Analysis:** Generates structured datasets for statistical modelling and policy evaluation.

### 🔹 **[MCMC Bayesian Model for Infection Estimation](https://github.com/eb1383/MCMC)**  

🧬 **How can we estimate disease spread with incomplete data?** This project applies a **Bayesian hierarchical model** using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods to estimate **infection rates** based on **travel and genetic data**.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- 📊 **Predictive Disease Modelling:** Uses **hierarchical Bayesian inference** to estimate hidden infections.  
- ✈️ **Accounts for Travel Data:** Incorporates mobility patterns to model transmission pathways.  
- 🧪 **Integrates Genetic Information:** Leverages genomic sequences for more accurate outbreak tracking.  
- ❓ **Handles Missing Data:** Uses probabilistic methods to adjust for incomplete records.
